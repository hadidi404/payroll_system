# Progress

## What Works
- **Fixed Redirect Loop:** The infinite redirect issue in `php/authentication.php` has been resolved by ensuring consistent session variable usage.
- **Resolved `session_start()` Notice:** The `Notice: session_start(): Ignoring session_start()` in `php/rates.php` has been fixed by adding a check to prevent multiple session starts.
- **Employee Listing:** Displays employee information from the database, now with an "Actions" column for direct editing and deleting. The header no longer contains separate edit and delete buttons.
- **Add Employee:** Form for adding new employees, now includes hour rate input and calculates SSS, Pag-IBIG, PhilHealth deductions automatically.
- **Delete Employee:** Functionality to delete one or multiple employees.
- **Login/Logout:** Basic authentication system.
- **Dashboard UI Improvements:** `btn_actions` are now positioned on the far right with adjusted margin. "Edit" and "Delete" links in the table are styled as buttons with thinner borders, normal font weight, a gap between them (removing the "|"), and consistent width.
- **Add Page UI Improvements:** The "Back" button is positioned on the edge of the main container, "Add New Employee" is centered, and the "Add Employee" button has the same width as the main container.

## What's Left to Build
- **Database Schema Update:** Crucial step to add `hour_rate`, `sss_deduction`, `pagibig_deduction`, and `philhealth_deduction` columns to the `employee_info` table.
- **Display Calculated Deductions:** Update `dashboard.php` and `payslip.php` to display the newly added `hour_rate` and calculated deduction amounts.
- **Edit Employee Functionality:** Modify `edit.php` to allow editing of the `hour_rate` and ensure deductions are recalculated/displayed correctly.
- **Payslip Generation:** Enhance `payslip.php` to use the new payroll data for comprehensive payslip generation.
- **Backup/Export:** Verify `backup.php` and `export.php` handle the new data correctly.

## Current Status
The core functionalities for adding and deleting employees are in place, with recent enhancements to the 'add' feature and direct action links in the dashboard. UI improvements have been made to both the dashboard and the add employee page. The system is awaiting database schema updates to fully support the new payroll calculations.

## Known Issues
- Database schema not yet updated for new columns, which will cause `add.php` to fail on insertion.
- Display and edit functionalities for new payroll data are not yet implemented.
